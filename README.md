Chrome / Edge (should work on any Chromium browser) extension for **Idle Automatic Bing Search**, a fork of <a href=https://github.com/AsoStrife/Bing-Search-Automator>AsoStrife's work</a>. 

This extension automatically performs an x number of searches on Bing with a 500ms delay between each, both in a mobile and desktop "environments", the first being a simulated one. All you have to do is click its toolbar icon or assign a shortcut in the extensions hub and choose the search type. Downloadable assets are published under <a href="https://github.com/kimi-builds/Bing-Search-Idlemate/releases">Releases</a>. 

Install it by dragging the compressed folder or the .crx file to your browser's extensions hub, having developer mode enabled.

## Known bugs
As in the original extension some searches will not count towards the points total. Appreciate possible solutions.
