Chrome / Edge (should work on any Chromium browser) extension for **Idle Automatic Bing Search**, a fork of <a href=https://github.com/AsoStrife/Bing-Search-Automator>AsoStrife's work</a>. 

This extension automatically performs an x number of searches on Bing with a 500ms delay between each. 
To open it as a regular tab (**only working (and desired) way for now**), install either the zipped or the packed version on your browser's extensions page and copy its ID from the address bar (for example, on MS Edge the format of the extensions settings page is edge://extensions/?id=[id]). Now enter <pre>chrome-extension://[idgoeshere]/index.html</pre> in the address and enjoy your tasks.

## Known bugs
As in the original extension some searches will not count towards the points total. Appreciate possible solutions. The popup is not behaving properly.
